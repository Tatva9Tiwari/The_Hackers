<p>Tsunami SOS:
Step one:
If you felt an earthquake, then you should try to stay away from the ocean at all times. This helps you survive the aftershock’s result in a tsunami. You need to get to higher ground and it needs to be much farther inland so that you can survive. If you can see the wave, keep moving farther away so that you can survive the tsunami. Stay away from any power lines as they might carry current and shock you with the water.
Step two:
Once the water has subsided, try to find other people and stick together. Call 911 as soon as possible, and if 911 doesn’t exist, then go find some help.
</p>Please refer to the GPS for navigation.
