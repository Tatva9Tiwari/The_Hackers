Hurricane SOS:
Step one:
Before the hurricane hits, you should try and leave the town.
If you don’t notice the hurricane is coming until the last moment, your best bet is to stay inside and away from any glass windows or doors as they could crack easily with the heavy winds. Another thing is to get to higher ground so that any floods won’t take you with them. If you are in a mobile home or if your home is on lower ground, then evacuate immediately and move to higher ground. Head to a hurricane shelter if possible, only if you house is on lower ground.
If your house is on higher ground, then try to secure the roof and walls with something, so that they don’t fly off.
Step two:
Try to ration food and water, so that you can live out the storm. Once the storm seems to have passed, then try to see if there’s any damage to your house, and then call for aid and try to help anyone that might be in danger.Please refer to the GPS for navigation.
