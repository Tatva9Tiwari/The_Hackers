<p>PANDEMIC INFO:
If there are reports of a sickness that is infecting people fast, you need to identify where it is affecting people, and once you have figured it out, you need to try to stay home as much as possible and avoid going out often. Only go outside if you need food and necessities, as you need those in order to stay strong, and to stay alive during the virus. Once the virus seems to have passed, then you can try to go outside, but avoid making contact with people for at least one week after it subsided. Please refer to the GPS for navigation.
