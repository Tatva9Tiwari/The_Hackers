<p>Earthquake SOS:
Step One:
If you are inside, take a moment to calm down and try to see how severe it is. Firstly, you need to take a look at the furniture and anything that isn’t locked down. If the furniture seems to be moving across the floor, then you need to get under a table as this might be a serious earthquake. If the couch is moving very slightly then it’s a mediocre earthquake and you should hide somewhere just to be safe.<br>
If you are outside, get yourself away from any tall buildings or trees, or electricity poles. The farther away from these you get, the better your chances are. If you cannot get too far away, get as far away as possible, and lay flat on the ground. Even if you can get as far away from buildings and tall objects, you should still lay yourself flat on the ground, and minimize your rolling around.<br>
Step Two:
Once it seems to have calmed down, if you are still indoors, get outdoors as soon as possible. This is because aftershocks exist, and often do a lot more damage than the original earthquakes. Upon going outside, try to get as far away from buildings as possible. After about fifteen minutes of the ground not shaking, you should head over to your nearest red cross/hospital. If you are in a time period before the existence of these,<br> you should try to get as much medical help as possible.
IMPORTANT: If you are close to the ocean, within a few miles of it, or are close to a river that is close to the ocean, get to higher ground as soon as possible, for it is very much possible for a tsunami to strike. See the Tsunami page for assistance.Please refer to the GPS for navigation.
