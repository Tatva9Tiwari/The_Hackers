    <p>Tornado:
Step one:
Before a tornado, you can always hear the sound of the winds. If you hear these sounds, which are similar to a waterfall, then you should immediately evacuate to your basement.<br>If you don’t have a basement, then you need to go to a room on the lowest floor of your building. Try to hide under a heavy table, as that will protect you from getting taken by the heavy winds. <br>If you are in a mobile home, evacuate immediately and try to find a basement or a room in a sturdy house to seek shelter in.
If you are outside, try to find shelter in a sturdy house, and stay away from trees.<br> Avoid buildings with a roof and 2 walls, aka a “long-span” building. These can collapse and get destroyed easily when the tornado comes near it, and you could die in the debris.
Step two:
Once the tornado has passed,<br> assess the damage and try to help anyone trapped under the debris, and contact 911 at once for aid. If you are at a time before 911 exists, you should try and treat your <br> injuries as best as you can in that time period. The Red Cross, and other hospitals have existed for a while, so you should probably head to these places as soon as possible. You can use our map for assistance.
