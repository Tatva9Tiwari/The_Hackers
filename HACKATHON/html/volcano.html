    <p>Volcano SOS:
Step one:
Check to see what type of volcano it is. If it is a rather flat volcano, shaped like a shield, with minimal ash, and lots of magma flows, it is a shield volcano. If it is a cone shaped volcano, with a steep slope, with lots of ash and lava flows, with it is a Stratovolcano/Composite volcano. If it is a cone shaped volcano with lots of ash, but minimal lava, it is a cinder volcano.
Step two:
If it is a shield volcano, your best bet is to try and analyze where the lava flows are. It is rare that the flows will exceed twenty kilometers an hour, so, under most circumstances, you should be able to outrun it on foot. However, it is still prudent to get some sort of vehicle. If you are currently before the eighteenth century, you should try and get a horse, and to outrun the flows. If you are after the eighteenth century, you should get a car, and try and outrun it. However, it is not even necessary to outrun it. Most flows arenâ€™t hot enough to melt stone, at least, not for several hours, so, if you are on top of a stone building that is at least two floors tall, you will make it through.
If it is a stratovolcano, under no circumstances should you stay in one place. Why? Because ash can bury you alive, solidifying within seconds, and causing you to suffocate on superheated liquid ashes. As such. Your best bet is to simply flee away, and await help. Swimming through rivers will not help, because ash flows can reach 180 miles an hour.
If it is a cinder volcano, your best bet is still the same as a stratovolcano, to get as far away.
Step Three:
Once you have survived, contact 911 or some other aid, in order to receive supplies and to be helped.Please refer to the GPS for navigation.
