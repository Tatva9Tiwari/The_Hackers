<p>Wildfire SOS:
 Step One:
 A wildfire is very fast, and can often consume trees in seconds. As such, you are best having fled imminently. This is because the wildfireâ€™s fast spreading nature allows it to completely surround you in minutes, leaving you with no escape route. So, you should first make sure if you can even flee. Fleeing on foot is sub par, on horseback, your horse will likely panic. So, unless you have a car, you should go to the nearest body of water and submerge yourself in it, only coming up to breath every few seconds.
Step two:
If you managed to outrun the fire, great. Get yourself treated for any injuries, and proceed with your life. If not, then stay in the water until someone helps dispel the fire or until the fire stops. Please refer to the GPS for navigation.
